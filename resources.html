                <h3>Base Color </h3>
                <p>I wanted to keep my design within certain boundaries so I chose a color in which to base all of my design
                    decisions on. I chose
                    <span style="color:#1b9397;">#3fffe8</span> as it was bright and stood out on the page without be unreadable or unaccessible for people
                    with colorblindness such as myself.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-6" id="colors-body">
                <h3>Colors used </h3>
                <p>From there I used the built in hexslider for VS Code to create a multitude of lighter and darker tones of
                    <span style="color:#1b9397;">#3fffe8</span> that would compliment the base color. The colors I used throughout the CV are all generated
                    from the base color. The darker tone used in the nvabar to highlight active usage was
                    <span style="color:#3e8c75;">#3e8c75</span>. The lighter tone used throughout the page was used in the darker areas to bring attention
                    to areas i wanted the user to see
                    <span style="color:rgb(20, 236, 200);"> rgb(20, 236, 200)</span>. This allowed for uniform color conformity across the page.</p>

                <h3>TyperWriter JS </h3>
                <p>I used Typerwriter JS which you can find at
                    <a href="https://github.com/tameemsafi/typewriterjs"> https://github.com/tameemsafi/typewriterjs </a> I used typerwriter js as its a powerful static tool that
                    allows developers to show Information and draw the users attention without crowding a piece of the Webpage.</p>

                <h3>Vanta JS </h3>
                <p>I used Vanta js which can be found at
                    <a href="https://github.com/tengbao/vanta"> https://github.com/tengbao/vanta </a> instead of particle js as I think that particle js as a banner
                    head can sometimes be not as enticing to the user as the effects can be drab. Vanta js allows the user
                    to be wowed as soon as they enter the page and has many effects that can be implemented.</p>

                <h3>Fonts used </h3>
                <p>I used
                    <span style="font-family:Bebas Neue;"> Bebas Neue</span> as it looked quite modern and drew the eye to the piece of information I wanted the
                    user to see. Eventually after seeing the font used in the heading titles and important information the
                    user would know that this information was important and should be read. I then used
                    <span style="font-family: 'Roboto';">
                        Roboto</span> for the inline body text as it was Important but was quite a bit longer in textsize
                    than the headers and is easier to read overall for the user. Both fonts were created by google and a
                    key access can be found here
                    <a href="https://fonts.google.com/"> https://fonts.google.com/ </a>

                <h3>Icons used</h3>
                <p>I used font-awesome to find all the fonts needed for the Website. Great thing about font-awesome is it allows
                    change of the icons with any css I wanted on the fly and allows for uniform color conformity across the
                    page. Font awesome keys can be generated here

                <h3>Bootstrap features used</h3>
                <p>
                    I used bootstraps accordion cards, modal, banner, Carousel, image formatting, page formatting and Button features. I also
                    used media Queries within my css, so that the page works perfectly in both mobile and Desktop mode. Effectively
                    having two seperate css sheets. Bootstraps in built mobile friendly features while good can still left
                    some things to be desired so Media Queries using css were needed to create a seemless experience no matter
                    the device.
